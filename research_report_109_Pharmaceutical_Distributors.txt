======================================================================
STAGE 6: RISK ASSESSMENT
======================================================================
## MAJOR RISKS

1. **Market Risk:** 
   - **What if demand isn't real?** Despite the complaints found, there is a risk that the demand for a new system might not be as strong as anticipated. Pharmaceutical distributors may be resistant to change due to the costs and effort associated with transitioning to a new system.

2. **Competitive Risk:** 
   - **What if incumbent responds?** Existing software providers could quickly enhance their offerings to address the identified pain points, leveraging their established customer base and resources.

3. **Operational Risk:** 
   - **What could go wrong in execution?** Implementing a new system could face challenges such as integration with existing processes, data migration issues, and user training, which could lead to disruptions in operations.

4. **Regulatory Risk:** 
   - **Compliance, legal, IP issues?** The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated. Any new system must comply with regulations like the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) in the U.S., which could complicate development and deployment.

5. **Technical Risk:** 
   - **What if we can't build it?** Developing a robust, scalable, and secure system that meets the specific needs of pharmaceutical distributors could be technically challenging, especially if real-time tracking and integration with existing systems are required.

## BARRIERS TO ENTRY

- **Licenses/certifications needed:** Compliance with industry regulations such as DSCSA, FDA guidelines, and potentially HIPAA if handling sensitive data.
- **Technical complexity:** Developing a system that integrates seamlessly with existing ERP systems and provides real-time updates.
- **Capital requirements:** Initial development costs, marketing, and sales efforts to penetrate the market.
- **Network effects:** Established players may have strong customer relationships and integrated solutions that create a lock-in effect.

## RED FLAGS / WARNING SIGNS

- **Red flag #1:** Low adoption rate of new technologies among target customers.
- **Red flag #2:** Strong resistance to change from current manual processes.
- **Red flag #3:** Existing solutions rapidly improving their offerings in response to market needs.

## WHY THIS COULD FAIL

1. **Resistance to change:** Distributors may be reluctant to switch from familiar Excel-based processes to a new system.
2. **Regulatory hurdles:** Navigating the complex regulatory environment could delay or prevent product launch.
3. **Competitive response:** Established software providers could quickly adapt and improve their solutions, making it difficult to gain market share.

## VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS

1. **Test #1:** Assess demand for a new system
   - **Method:** Conduct surveys and interviews with pharmaceutical distributors to gauge interest and willingness to adopt a new system.
   - **Success criteria:** Positive feedback from at least 60% of respondents indicating a strong interest in switching from Excel.
