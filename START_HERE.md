## 🎯 Scale It Up

Once test works, generate hundreds of ideas:

```bash
# Generate lots of ideas
python generate_ideas.py  # Run 5-10 times
python generate_ideas.py
python generate_ideas.py
python generate_ideas.py
python generate_ideas.py

# Now you have 150+ ideas in queue
```

Run research in background (processes until queue empty):

```bash
nohup python pain_finder.py > research.log 2>&1 &

# Watch live logs
tail -f research.log
```

---

## 📊 How The 5-Stage Validation Works

Each idea goes through:

1. **Raw Complaints** → Find 5+ people complaining with numbers
2. **Quantification** → Get 3+ sources with hard data
3. **Market Size** → Verify 5,000+ businesses affected
4. **Competition** → Check for 0-2 weak competitors
5. **Documentation** → Create detailed pain profile

**Must pass ALL 5 stages** to be marked "VERIFIED"

## 🏆 What To Do With Winners

2. **Manually validate:**
   - Find 20 people in that niche on LinkedIn
   - Send message: *"Quick question: do you spend [X hours/week] on [Y task]? Looking to solve this."*
   - Track responses
3. **If 50%+ say YES → Build it!**
