======================================================================
STAGE 6: RISK ASSESSMENT
======================================================================
## MAJOR RISKS

1. **Market Risk:** 
   - **What if demand isn't real?** Despite the complaints, the actual demand for a new solution might not be as high as perceived. Businesses might be accustomed to Excel and reluctant to change due to cost or learning curve concerns.

- **Red flag #2:** High resistance to change from potential users.
- **Red flag #3:** Difficulty in differentiating the solution from existing products.

## WHY THIS COULD FAIL

1. **Resistance to Change:** Users may prefer to stick with Excel due to familiarity, despite its inefficiencies.
2. **Competitive Pressure:** Larger, established companies could quickly adapt and outcompete a new entrant.
3. **Technical Challenges:** Developing a solution that meets all user needs and integrates seamlessly with existing systems could be more complex than anticipated.

## VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS

1. **Test #1:** **Demand Validation**
   - **Method:** Conduct surveys and interviews with potential customers to gauge interest and willingness to switch from Excel.
   - **Success criteria:** Positive feedback from at least 70% of respondents indicating a willingness to adopt a new solution.
   - **Cost/Time:** $500, 2 weeks

2. **Test #2:** **Prototype Testing**
   - **Method:** Develop a basic prototype and offer it to a small group of businesses for free in exchange for feedback.
   - **Success criteria:** At least 50% of users find the prototype significantly improves efficiency over Excel.
   - **Cost/Time:** $5,000, 1 month

3. **Test #3:** **Competitive Analysis**
   - **Method:** Analyze existing solutions and their market share to identify gaps and opportunities.
   - **Success criteria:** Identification of at least three unique features or improvements that could provide a competitive edge.
   - **Cost/Time:** $1,000, 2 weeks

## VERDICT: PROCEED

- **PROCEED** if: The validation experiments show strong demand, positive feedback on the prototype, and clear differentiation from competitors.
