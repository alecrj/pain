======================================================================
STAGE 6: RISK ASSESSMENT
======================================================================
## MAJOR RISKS

1. **Market Risk:** 
   - **What if demand isn't real?** While there are complaints about the current process, it's possible that the demand for a digital solution is overestimated. Some companies may prefer to stick with traditional methods due to cost concerns or resistance to change.

2. **Competitive Risk:** 
   - **What if incumbent responds?** Established companies in the construction management software space, like Procore or Autodesk, could quickly enhance their offerings to include better subcontractor compliance tracking, leveraging their existing customer base and resources.

3. **Operational Risk:** 
   - **What could go wrong in execution?** Implementing a new digital system could face resistance from employees accustomed to current methods. Additionally, ensuring data accuracy and integration with existing systems could pose challenges.

4. **Regulatory Risk:** 
   - **Compliance, legal, IP issues?** Ensuring that the digital solution complies with industry regulations and data protection laws is crucial. There could also be intellectual property challenges if similar solutions already exist.

5. **Technical Risk:** 
   - **What if we can't build it?** Developing a robust, user-friendly system that integrates seamlessly with existing tools and handles large volumes of data efficiently could be technically challenging.

## BARRIERS TO ENTRY

- **Licenses/certifications needed:** Depending on the features offered, certifications related to data security and compliance with industry standards may be necessary.
- **Technical complexity:** Developing a system that integrates with various existing platforms and scales effectively can be complex.
- **Capital requirements:** Initial development and marketing costs could be significant, especially if competing against established players.
- **Network effects:** Incumbents may have strong customer loyalty and established integrations, making it difficult for new entrants to gain traction.

## RED FLAGS / WARNING SIGNS
