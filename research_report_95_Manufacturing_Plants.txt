======================================================================
STAGE 6: RISK ASSESSMENT
======================================================================
## MAJOR RISKS

1. **Market Risk:** There is a risk that the demand for digital solutions to replace paper maintenance logs is not as strong as anticipated. While complaints exist, it's possible that many manufacturing plants are either satisfied with their current systems or have already adopted digital solutions.

2. **Competitive Risk:** Established players in the digital maintenance management space, such as IBM Maximo, SAP PM, and others, may respond aggressively to new entrants by enhancing their offerings or reducing prices, making it difficult for a new solution to gain traction.

3. **Operational Risk:** Implementing a digital solution requires significant changes in workflow and employee training. There is a risk that the transition from paper to digital could be more complex and time-consuming than anticipated, leading to resistance from staff and potential disruptions in operations.

4. **Regulatory Risk:** Compliance with industry standards and regulations related to data security and privacy is critical. Failure to adhere to these could lead to legal issues and damage to reputation.

5. **Technical Risk:** Developing a robust, user-friendly digital solution that integrates seamlessly with existing systems and equipment could be technically challenging. There is a risk that the solution may not perform as expected or may encounter integration issues.

## BARRIERS TO ENTRY

- **Licenses/certifications needed:** Compliance with ISO standards for quality management systems and possibly certifications related to IT security standards like ISO/IEC 27001.
  
- **Technical complexity:** Developing a solution that can integrate with diverse existing systems and handle large volumes of data efficiently.

- **Capital requirements:** Initial investment in software development, marketing, and customer support infrastructure.

- **Network effects:** Incumbents may have strong customer relationships and established ecosystems that make it difficult for new entrants to gain market share.

## RED FLAGS / WARNING SIGNS

- **Red flag #1:** Low engagement or interest from potential customers during initial outreach or pilot programs.
  
- **Red flag #2:** High customer satisfaction with existing solutions, indicating a lack of urgency to switch.
  
- **Red flag #3:** Significant technical challenges or delays in developing a viable product.

## WHY THIS COULD FAIL

1. **Lack of Market Adoption:** If manufacturing plants are not convinced of the value or necessity of switching to a digital solution, they may not adopt the new system.

2. **Competitive Pressure:** Established competitors with more resources and market presence could outcompete a new entrant.

3. **Implementation Challenges:** Difficulty in integrating with existing systems and processes could lead to poor user adoption and dissatisfaction.

## VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS
