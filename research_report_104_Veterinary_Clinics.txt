## PATTERN ANALYSIS
The core problem is the inefficiency and time consumption associated with manually reminding pet owners about appointments and vaccinations. This task diverts valuable time from other critical veterinary functions and leads to frustration among staff. The lack of automation in this process is causing clinics to lose hours weekly, which could be better spent on patient care or other administrative duties. The urgency is evident as clinics are actively seeking solutions to streamline this process.

## VERDICT: PROCEED
The evidence shows a clear and urgent pain point for veterinary clinics regarding manual appointment reminders. With 5+ real complaints from various sources, it's evident that this is a problem people want solved now. The consistent mention of time wasted and the search for better systems indicate a strong market need for an automated solution.
