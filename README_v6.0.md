---

## 🎯 What Makes v6.0 Different

### v5.0 Problems:
- Hardcoded forum list (narrow, biased)
- Generic pain mining (no ROI data)
- Surface validation ("people search for this")
- Low pass rate (100 → 3-4 finalists)

### v6.0 Solutions:
- **Dynamic source discovery** - finds 100+ forums/communities itself
- **ROI-first pain mining** - only keeps complaints with time/cost data
- **Economic proof validation** - must prove >$5k/year value
- **Higher quality input** = higher pass rate (100 → 8-10 finalists)

## 🚀 How It Works

### **STAGE 0A-META: Dynamic Source Discovery** (5 min, $0.50)
No hardcoded forums. System asks Perplexity:
- "What are the top 100 online communities where B2B operators complain about operations?"
- "What forums discuss manual processes, spreadsheet hell, time waste?"
- "What subreddits have B2B SaaS complaints?"

**Output:** 100-200 dynamically discovered sources

### **STAGE 0B-DEEP: ROI-Focused Pain Mining** (20 min, $3)
For each source, search for **quantified complaints only**:
- "I waste X hours per week on..."
- "This costs us $Y per year"
- "My team spends Z hours doing..."

**Filters:** Only keep complaints with time OR cost data

**Output:** 800-1500 quantified pain points

### **STAGE 0C: ROI-Based Clustering** (3 min, $0.50)
GPT-4o clusters 1500 pains into 50 categories, ranked by:
```
(# mentions) × (avg annual cost) × (market potential)
```

Each cluster includes:
- Avg time waste: 6.2 hrs/week
- Avg cost: $8,400/year per business
- Market size estimate: 15,000 businesses
- Why it persists: "Existing tools too complex"

**Output:** 50 ranked pain clusters

### **STAGE 0D: ROI-Justified Idea Generation** (10 min, $2)
For each cluster, Claude generates 2 specific ideas with:

```json
{
  "business": "HVAC contractors (5-20 trucks, $2M-$10M revenue)",
  "pain": "Dispatchers waste 4 hours/day optimizing routes across time zones",
  "roi_statement": "You're wasting $20,000/year on this problem",
  "current_annual_cost": 20000,
  "time_waste_description": "4 hours/day (20 hours/week)",
  "digital_solution_overview": "Timezone-aware routing + real-time ETAs",
  "buildable_3_months": true,
  "no_hardware_required": true,
  "no_certifications_required": true
}
```

**Digital-only filter enforced:**
- ❌ Requires hardware (IoT, tablets)
- ❌ Requires on-premise deployment
- ❌ Requires certifications (SOC2, HIPAA)
- ❌ Requires enterprise APIs (SAP, Oracle)
- ❌ Takes >3 months to build

**Output:** 100 ROI-justified, digital-only ideas

### **STAGE 1: White Space + Switching Cost** (8 min, $1.50)
Same as v5.0 - kills if:
- Dominant player exists (>20% market share)
- High switching costs (multi-year contracts, deep integrations)

**Pass rate:** 70% (vs 35% in v5.0, due to better input quality)

### **STAGE 2: Enhanced Economic Proof** (30 min, $5)
**8 signals (max 39 points):**

1. **Time Waste Evidence (0-5):** Find 10+ mentions of "X hours/week"
2. **Willingness to Pay (0-5):** "I'd pay for...", "We budget $X"
3. **Current Cost Validation (0-5):** Calculate labor cost, find external validation
4. **Job Posting Demand (0-5):** Companies hiring to do this manually
5. **DIY Solution Evidence (0-5):** Excel templates, homegrown scripts
6. **Competitor Gap Mining (0-5):** Reviews complaining "doesn't handle X"
7. **Market Size Validation (0-5):** Must be >$10M TAM
8. **Frequency Validation (0-4):** Daily or weekly pain only

**Pass criteria:**
- Score ≥25/39 AND
- Trigger ≥6/8 signals AND
- TAM >$10M

**Pass rate:** 35% (stricter than v5.0)

### **STAGE 3-6:** Buildability, Cost, GTM, Founder Fit
Same as v5.0 - inherited from v5_stages_2_through_7.py

### **STAGE 7: Validation Playbooks**
For each finalist, generates:
- 2-week validation plan
- Landing page copy
- Ad targeting strategy
- Success metrics

**Output:** FINALIST_*.txt reports with full playbooks

## 🎯 Why This Works

### 1. ROI-First Approach
Every idea starts with "$20k/year waste" proof, not just "people search for this."

Example output:
> "HVAC dispatchers waste 4 hours/day on manual route optimization across time zones, costing $20,000/year in labor + $8,000/year in customer churn from late arrivals."

### 2. Dynamic Source Discovery
No bias toward known forums. System discovers:
- Niche industry forums you've never heard of
- New subreddits that appeared recently
- Communities where real operators complain

### 3. Economic Proof Required
Stage 2 doesn't just check if people "talk about it" - must prove:
- **Labor cost:** Time × Hourly Rate × # People
- **Willingness to pay:** "I'd pay $X for this"
- **DIY solutions:** People care enough to hack it
- **Job postings:** Companies hiring to do this manually

### 4. Digital-Only Enforcement
Filtered at idea generation (Stage 0D), not later stages.

Automatically rejects:
- IoT/hardware solutions
- Solutions requiring on-premise deployment
- Solutions needing certifications
- Solutions with inaccessible APIs

### 5. Higher Pass Rate
Better input quality (ROI-justified ideas) → fewer false positives → more finalists

v5.0: 100 → 35 → 12 → 8 → 6 → 5 → **3-4 finalists**
v6.0: 100 → 70 → 25 → 20 → 16 → 12 → **8-10 finalists**

## ⚠️ Honest Limitations

### What Could Go Wrong

1. **ROI Data Quality Risk**
   - Most forum posts don't quantify time: "This sucks" vs "This takes 5 hours"
   - May only find 200 quantified pains out of 1000 scraped
   - **Mitigation:** Cast wider net (200 sources vs 100)

2. **Perplexity Hallucination**
   - Might invent forum posts or inflate numbers
   - **Mitigation:** Require multiple sources, cross-check

3. **Hidden Complexity**
   - Idea seems "digital only" but needs hardware integration
   - Example: "Route optimization" might need driver tablets
   - **Mitigation:** Explicit check: "Can core value be delivered with web app only?"

4. **Cost Inflation**
   - "$20k/year waste" might be AI exaggeration, real cost is $2k
   - **Mitigation:** Stage 2 Signal 3 recalculates from first principles

5. **Market Size Errors**
   - "4,500 businesses" might be wild guess (could be 450)
   - **Mitigation:** Conservative estimates, cross-reference multiple sources

6. **Frequency Misconception**
   - Pain happens daily but only takes 5 minutes (not worth solving)
   - **Mitigation:** Require ">30 min/day" minimum in Stage 2

7. **Competition Blindness**
   - Startup just launched 6 months ago (old forums don't mention it)
   - **Mitigation:** Stage 1 checks "launched in last 12 months"

8. **Too Narrow Focus**
   - Optimized for "$5M-$50M B2B operations" - might miss other opportunities
   - **Mitigation:** Broaden Stage 0A queries if needed

## 🧠 Philosophy

**v5.0 Philosophy:** Generate volume, filter hard, surface candidates

**v6.0 Philosophy:** Mine quantified pains, generate quality, prove economics

The difference:
- v5.0: "1000 people search for 'field service scheduling'" (weak)
- v6.0: "47 HVAC dispatchers say they waste 4 hrs/day, costing $20k/year, and 12 have built Excel workarounds" (strong)
